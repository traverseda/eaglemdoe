class emEngine : public emUncopyable {

public:

	// The classes emEngine, emSignal and emScheduler can be used for some
	// kind of CPU sharing and event handling, within one thread of
	// execution.
	//
	// The central point is the virtual method Cycle of emEngine. Derived
	// classes have to overload it for doing something useful in it.
	//
	// Polling
	// -------
	//
	// One possibility is that Cycle could be called by the scheduler on
	// every time slice. The size of a time slice is defined by the actual
	// derivative of emScheduler. It should be about 10 millisecs.
	//
	// Such a polling can be made by waking up the engine once through
	// calling WakeUp, and by always returning true from the Cycle call.
	//
	// Not polling
	// -----------
	//
	// For sparing CPU cycles, polling should be used in rare cases only.
	// Best is to let the engine sleep most times, and to wake it up
	// whenever there is something useful to do.
	//
	// After calling WakeUp on an engine, Cycle is called by the scheduler
	// within the current time slice. The Cycle call should return false for
	// falling asleep again.
	//
	// Through the wake-up mechanism, Cycle can be called multiple times
	// within one time slice. For example, this allows to have chains of
	// signals without any delay through the time slices.
	//
	// Signals
	// -------
	//
	// emSignal can be used for sending a unary event to the engines without
	// having references to them. But all receiving engines must share the
	// same scheduler, and the sender must have a reference to that
	// scheduler. Very often, the sender is even an engine.
	//
	// An engine can receive a signal event by calling IsSignaled from
	// within Cycle. To avoid polling, an engine can be woken up by signals.
	// Therefore any number of signals can be connected to an engine with
	// AddWakeUpSignal.
	//
	// Here is an example of how a sender can send two different signals A
	// and B to receivers:
	//
	// class MySender : public emEngine {
	// private:
	//   emSignal A;
	//   emSignal B;
	// public:
	//   inline MySender(emScheduler & scheduler) : emEngine(scheduler) {}
	//   inline const emSignal & GetSignalA() const { return A; }
	//   inline const emSignal & GetSignalB() const { return B; }
	//   inline void SendA() { Signal(A); }
	//   inline void SendB() { Signal(B); }
	// };
	//
	// class MyReceiver : public emEngine {
	// private:
	//   MySender & Sender;
	// public:
	//   inline MyReceiver(MySender & sender)
	//     : emEngine(sender.GetScheduler()), Sender(sender)
	//   {
	//     AddWakeUpSignal(Sender.GetSignalA());
	//     AddWakeUpSignal(Sender.GetSignalB());
	//   }
	// protected:
	//   virtual bool Cycle();
	// };
	//
	// bool MyReceiver::Cycle()
	// {
	//   if (IsSignaled(Sender.GetSignalA())) {
	//     //...got signal A...
	//   }
	//   if (IsSignaled(Sender.GetSignalB())) {
	//     //...got signal B...
	//   }
	//   return false;
	// }
	//
	// Minimum fairness
	// ----------------
	//
	// A call to Cycle should not block for a too long time. If an engine
	// wants to perform a long-time job, it should divide that job into
	// multiple time slices. The method IsTimeSliceAtEnd can be helpful
	// here. Example:
	//
	// bool JobEngine::Cycle()
	// {
	//   while (!JobFinished()) {
	//     WorkOnTheJobALittleBit();
	//     if (IsTimeSliceAtEnd()) break;
	//   }
	//   return !JobFinished();
	// }
	//
	// The above example provides just minimum fairness, because if there
	// are two such job engines, one would always eat the whole time slice
	// and the other would perform WorkOnTheJobALittleBit only once per time
	// slice.
	//
	// ??? More fairness for parallel jobs may be supported in the future.
	// ??? Maybe the return value of Cycle should be replaced by a method.
	//
	// There is a helper for serializing jobs: emPriSchedAgent

		// Remove the given signal from the set of signals waking up
		// this engine. If a signal has been added multiple times, it

		// it would really be disconnected from the engine (this is for
		// solving conflicts between base classes and derived classes:
		// the derived class does not need to know whether the base
		// class has added a certain signal for its own purpose). There
		// is no need to remove signals before destruction of signals or
		// engines. This is solved by the destructors more efficient.

		// Ask whether the given signal has been signaled. This must be

		// of the current call to Cycle.
