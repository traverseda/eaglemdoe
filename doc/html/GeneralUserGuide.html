<H1><A NAME="1"></A>1 Introduction</H1>
Eagle Mode is a zoomable user interface with many plugin applications. This
documents describes its general usage and gives hints where to find further
help.

<H2><A NAME="1.1"></A>1.1 Windows, views and panels</H2>
In Eagle Mode, the user interface is made of windows, views and panels. A window
is such a thing on the desktop that has a title bar, a border and a content
area. The content area of a window is made of one or more views. Such a view
shows something like a two-dimensional virtual world which can be zoomed and
scrolled. That "world" consists of panels. A panel can be a simple thing like a
button or an input field, or it can be a more complex thing like a group or a
plugin application. Each panel can have child panels which are making up more
details. This relationship of parents and children is also called a tree of
panels. Thus, each view shows a tree of panels.

<H2><A NAME="1.2"></A>1.2 Content view and control view</H2>
The main window of Eagle Mode has two views: a large content view at the bottom
and a small control view at the top. The content view is for the things you are
working on, and the control view is for commands, status information, settings
and similar things. One could say the control view is a replacement for classic
menu bars, tool bars and status bars. It has the popup-zoom feature (described
more below).
<P>
<CENTER><IMG WIDTH=573 HEIGHT=283 BORDER=0 SRC="images/ControlAndContent.png"></CENTER>
<P>
There is a slider for sizing the control view. You can drag it up and down with
the left mouse button. A double click on it minimizes or unminimizes the control
view.
<P>
The control view itself is divided into two parts. On the left is a general
control panel which always stays the same. And on the right is a
context-sensitive control panel. This means, the right control panel depends on
what is activated (focused) in the content view. Just navigate around in the
content view and see how the right part of the control view changes. Note that
some content panels do not provide any control panel, and so they leave the
right side of the control view empty.

<H2><A NAME="1.3"></A>1.3 Popup-zoom</H2>
Some views have the popup-zoom feature. It means that when you zoom in, the view
pops up and gets larger so that it is clipped by the screen bounds only. This
makes small views much more comfortable, but it is suitable only for certain
views like the control view and dialog windows.
<P>
Similar to a classic popup menu, a popup-zoomed view automatically pops down
when you click outside, or when you trigger a button in it. Not all buttons have
that effect, but most of them. If you want to trigger a button without popping
the view down, hold the Shift key while triggering the button.


<H1><A NAME="2"></A>2 Mouse control</H1>
This chapter describes how you can navigate through the panels of a view, using
the mouse.

<H2><A NAME="2.1"></A>2.1 Zooming by mouse wheel</H2>
For zooming in, move the mouse pointer to the location where you want to zoom
in, and then push the mouse wheel upwards. For zooming out, push the wheel
downwards.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG WIDTH=350 HEIGHT=153 BORDER=0 SRC="images/MouseFunc1.png"></CENTER>
<P>
Tips:
<UL>
	<LI>For a slower zooming, hold the Shift key or the middle mouse button
	while pushing the wheel.</LI>
	<P>
	<LI>By zooming in and out with different mouse positions, you can
	simulate a scrolling.</LI>
	<P>
	<LI>If you want to zoom into a panel which is, for example, on the right
	side of the view, then you should position the mouse pointer near the
	right edge of that panel. Thereby, and with some practice, you can get
	the panel somewhat centered when you zoom in.</LI>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="2.2"></A>2.2 Zooming by mouse movement</H2>
For zooming by mouse movement, press and hold the Ctrl key and the middle mouse
button, and move the mouse vertically. (With most mice, wheel and middle button
are the same unit)
<P>
<CENTER><IMG WIDTH=354 HEIGHT=168 BORDER=0 SRC="images/MouseFunc4.png"></CENTER>
<P>
Tips:
<UL>
	<LI>The initial mouse position is like with zooming by wheel.</LI>
	<P>
	<LI>Hold the Shift key for a slower zooming.</LI>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="2.3"></A>2.3 Scrolling by mouse movement</H2>
For scrolling, press and hold the middle mouse button, and move the mouse into
the desired scroll direction.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG WIDTH=397 HEIGHT=166 BORDER=0 SRC="images/MouseFunc2.png"></CENTER>
<P>
Tips:
<UL>
	<LI>Hold the Shift key for a slower scrolling.</LI>
	<P>
	<LI>After scrolling (or zooming) with the mouse, a "magnetism" may get
	active, which scrolls and zooms automatically to show the nearest panel
	full-sized. You can prohibit that magnetism by holding the mouse still
	for about one second before releasing the middle mouse button.</LI>
	<P>
	<LI>The preferences provide an option for reversing the direction of
	scrolling in relation to the direction of moving the mouse. (The
	preferences are in the general control panel near the upper left corner
	of the Eagle Mode window)</LI>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="2.4"></A>2.4 Showing a panel full-sized, by mouse</H2>
For showing a panel full-sized so that it fits into the view, double-click with
the middle mouse button on the panel. And for showing a panel full-sized so that
the view is completely utilized, triple-click or shift-double-click with the
middle mouse button on the panel.
<P>
With some panel types, this function depends on the size and layout of the panel
contents. Then it is a good idea to repeat the function after the panel has
loaded or changed.
<P>

<H1><A NAME="3"></A>3 Keyboard control</H1>

<H2><A NAME="3.1"></A>3.1 Keyboard focus</H2>
There is always at most one panel on the screen which has the (keyboard) focus.
Any keyboard input goes to that focused panel. The focus is shown by small
arrows which surround the panel and point to it. There are several ways to move
the focus to another panel. One is to zoom into the desired panel, another is to
click with the mouse on it. Further ways are described more below.
<P>
Views and windows can also be focused: The focused panel is always in the
focused view, and the focused view is always in the focused window.
<P>
The focused panel is even called the active panel of a view. It remains active
even when the view and the panel are losing the focus. In that state, the active
panel is still indicated by arrows, but more pale. As soon as the view is
focused again, its active panel is automatically focused too.

<H2><A NAME="3.2"></A>3.2 General keyboard functions</H2>
The following table describes the keyboard functions for zooming and scrolling,
as well as for moving the focus.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="3.3"></A>3.3 About hotkeys</H2>
<P>
Many buttons of the control panels can be triggered by entering hotkeys. They
are documented in the button descriptions - just zoom into the buttons to see
those descriptions.
<P>
Important to know is that the hotkeys are functioning only when a panel in the
content view is focused. For technical reasons they are not functioning when
something in the control view is focused.


<H1><A NAME="4"></A>4 Finding more help</H1>
Many help texts can be found directly in the panels they are describing - just
zoom in! Toolkit panels like buttons, input fields and groups often have a
description right below their caption. In addition, interactive toolkit panels
like buttons and input fields have general help texts ("How to use this panel")
very small in the center of the left edge of the border. For example, a text
input field describes all its functions there.
<P>
The file manager is described in another document: <A
HREF="emFileManUserGuide.html"><I>emFileMan User Guide</I></A>
<P>
The games SilChess, emMines, and emNetwalk are showing help texts in their
control panels.


<H1><A NAME="5"></A>5 When Eagle Mode hangs</H1>
Sometimes Eagle Mode may hang for a short time. This could happen when zooming
into a slow medium like a floppy disk, or when zooming into a disk that has to
be woken up from a sleep state. Another reason could be that the operating
system is busy in executing disk write operations which have been cached some
time before.
<P>
If it actually happens that Eagle Mode hangs and you feel that it does not
respond to input, do not give wild input. Just wait - Eagle Mode will respond to
the last input as soon as it gets active again.
<P>
If you think Eagle Mode hangs forever and you are in a fullscreen mode and you
don't know how to come out, then you could try the following key combinations in
that order: Alt+F4 (close window), Alt+Tab (switch to another window),
Ctrl+Alt+Backspace twice (kill the X-Server and all windows), Ctrl+Alt+Del (soft
reset or reboot - kills everything). If all that does not help, you may have to
hard reset the computer, but note that this could mean some damage to the file
system (don't do it before there is no disk activity for a long time).
