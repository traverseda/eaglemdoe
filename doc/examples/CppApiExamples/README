This directory contains the example programs from the C++ API Tutorial. Except
for the PluginExample, you can run the examples easily with the help of
run-example.pl. For example:

  perl run-example.pl HelloWorldExample.cpp

If you want to run the PluginExample, then you would have to copy all the files
from the PluginExample directory tree into the Eagle Mode source directory tree
(see that they have the same directory structure), and then you could compile,
install and run Eagle Mode as usual.
